Transcendently beautiful in moments outside the office, it seems almost
sitcom-like in those scenes. When Toni Colette walks out and ponders
life silently, it's gorgeous.<br /><br />The movie doesn't seem to decide

doesn't matter. (The worst is sort of tedious - like Office Space with less humor.)
